			tropeExplanations: ['A versatile and extremely powerful fighter, especially while using her oni horn', "Becomes if she loses control of her emotions while using her oni horn.", "Compared to her sister, Rem is more skilled in every form of housework, but Rem doesn't think positively about her skill.

Even after gaining superior skill as a maid, Rem never thinks better of herself.", "Was initially distant and distrustful of Subaru due to his Witch's scent, but through their trials learns to trust and even deeply admire and love him.", 'She is also an oni and still has a full horn, which grants her strength greater than Ram.'],

	tropes: [
		{
			name: 'Action Girl', 
			description: "An Action Girl is a female badass who is tough and kicks butt. Damsel in Distress? Not her. She's featured in far more than the Designated Girl Fight. Expect regular appearances in actions scenes, facing dangerous foes and deadly obstacles, and expect her to win."
		},
		{
			name: 'Adorkable', 
			description: `The word "Adorkable" is a portmanteau of "Adorable" and "Dork." That neatly encapsulates this trope. Adorkable characters are "dorky" in some fashion. Maybe they're socially inept or shy. Maybe they're really clumsy. Maybe they have some really, really conspicuous character tic that tends to earn them weird looks. Maybe they're just so darn sweet, that it borders on embarrassing. Heck, maybe they're just an out-and-out Nerd. However, rather than making them an outcast, these quirks give the character an endearing vulnerability.`
		},
		{
			name: 'Flower in Her Hair', 
			description: 'Flowers have long been a symbol of femininity, and therefore young women (and those who are young at heart) sometimes wear them in their hair.'
		},
		{
			name: 'The Berserker', 
			description: `The Berserker is a character who throws himself into a fight with such reckless abandon, it seems like he wants to die. It could be over-enthusiasm, overconfidence, Unstoppable Rage, or the desire to die (in battle). Whatever the cause, it's usually accompanied by a bellowing warcry. Sometimes with total obliviousness to whether he's actually fighting the enemy. And he never, ever retreats.`
		},
		{
			name: 'Broken Ace', 
			description: `He's tall, charming, strikingly good-looking, well-spoken in five different languages, and classically trained in even more instruments. He's the Big Man on Campus, former president of the Absurdly Powerful Student Council, valedictorian, and working on his doctorate in a scientific field that a peon like you can't even pronounce. He always wears a suit...until the eventual Shirtless Scene during his (strenuous) exercise routine, that is. He has a lovely smile.`
		},
		{
			name: 'Defrosting Ice Queen', 
			description: `She is the Ice Queen (and sometimes An Ice Person): cool, reserved, and giving nothing away. She may want love as ardently as anyone, but she masks her soft heart behind a wall of ice. It is up to her Love Interest to soften her cold demeanor and win her love. (Substitute "Ice King" if more applicable.)`
		},
		{
			name: 'Oni', 
			description: `Oni are brutish mountain Youkai similar to trolls and Ogres, with either one or two horns (which in some depictions are the source of their power). The word is almost always translated into English as "ogres" or "demons". They are sometimes depicted as good or bad, but are usually morally neutral and interested in their own affairs. They prefer huge bludgeoning weapons (iron clubs called kanabou being the most common) and hide loincloths (usually tiger-striped). They are also shown to really love their alcohol, which can make them even more rowdy. Sometimes blamed for streaks of misfortune. Others work jobs in Fire and Brimstone Hell as big red devils.`
		},
		{
			name: 'The Stoic', 
			description: `He can be in the middle of a gunfight, his best friend's bachelor party, or a helpless witness to the death of everyone and everything he holds dear... and he'll show all the emotional reaction of a victim of a Botox overdose. They can be Heroes, antagonists or anti-heroes. On The Team he will contrast the Hot-Blooded. His quiet demeanor tends towards the brusque or outright rudeness, though there are a few polite Stoics. Some stoics may try to give the impression of a lot going on inside, cultivate an air of mystery and confuse other characters with cryptic one-liners.`
		},
		{
			name: 'Pragmatic Hero',
			description: `Most great fictional heroes fall into one of two broad categories: the Ideal Hero, such as The Cape or a Knight in Shining Armor who is pretty much exactly what one would hope for in a hero - skilled, courageous, morally pure, etc., and the Anti-Hero, who lacks one or more qualities normally considered necessary for an Ideal Hero. For example, a Classical Anti-Hero lacks ability or self-confidence. A Knight in Sour Armor lacks a positive attitude, and a Nominal Hero lacks morally pure intentions and has purely selfish motivation.`
